### 4. Database, Wordpress Configuration

In the script, there is the mysql_secure_installation command. I recommend using the following answers to the prompts:
Follow the prompts to:
 - Validate Plugin Password : n
 
 I recommend "n" to avoid errors but in some cases answering "y" works. 
 **note** if you are sure to answer "y" I recommend choosing a low level for the password
 - Remove anonymous users : y
 - Disallow root login remotely : n

 **dont use in production** 
 - Remove the test database : y
 
 - Reload privilege tables : y
 
After this prompt there is another prompt as well. The installation script will prompt you to enter wordpress database configuration details. 
- Wordpress username
- Wordpress Password 
- Wordpress Database Name

### 5. Complete the Installation

Once the script completes, WordPress will be installed and ready for use. You can proceed with configuring the WordPress installation through the web interface by visiting your siteâ€™s URL.
